# home-media-management
Setup tools for home media management using Plex or Emby with private automatic management.

### Construct Components:

#### Virtualization:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - container virtualization using less resources (disk space, RAM, etc.) then full virtual solutions.
- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) - web based docker manager making docker container management easy.

#### Media Servers
- [Plex](https://plex.tv/) - popular web based media library manager.
- [Emby](https://emby.media) - web based media library manager.

#### Download Automation

Original
---------------------------------------------------------

### My _almost_ perfect media server setup consists of:

#### Media Servers
- [PLEX!](https://plex.tv/) - If you don't know what Plex is, you should start here - Plex is the ultimate Media Server, with apps for iOS, Android, numerous smart TV's and all the rest - It's truly a one-stop media shop.
- [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio/) - Your own personal self hosted music server (Think of this as self hosting Spotify or Apple Music!)
- [TvHeadend](https://tvheadend.org/) - Plex is actually configured to talk to this - It's a server to pull in your favorite IPTV or Over-the-air TV Channels (if you have a hardware TV Tuner/Card), Now you can finally cut the cord!

#### Download Automation
- [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) - Automatically grabs your favourite TV shows, sends them to your download client & organises the files.
- [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) - A fork of Sonarr, but for Movies.
- [Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio/) - A fork of Sonarr, but for all your favorite music - Great for pulling in AAC/FLAC tracks that you can't get on Spotify if you're an Audiophile.
- [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) - API integration of all of the most popular Torrent Trackers for Sonarr/Radarr.
- [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)  - Reliable, lightweight linux torrent client

#### Tools & Scripts
- [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com/) - A monitoring and tracking tool for Plex (Think of this as Google Analytics for Plex)
- [PlexConnect](https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect) - Hijacks the trailers app on your AppleTV 2/3 (and replaces it with Plex) 
- [Ombi](https://ombi.io/) - Great way for your friends/family to request (and automate) adding new content to your Plex Server
- [Openspeedtest](http://openspeedtest.com/) - Handy to have to test the upload/download speed for your friends/family streaming from you.
- [Beets](http://beets.io/) - This is an essential tool for managing your MP3 library / cleaning up ID3 tags, pulling in Cover Art & Lyrics etc...
- [tvhProxy](https://github.com/jkaberg/tvhProxy) - This is how you can seamlessly connect TvHeadend into Plex
- [WebGrab+Plus](http://www.webgrabplus.com/) - This is how you pull in all the EPG (TV Guides) from various sites to Plex without having to use a paid metadata TV Guide service...
- [piHole](https://pi-hole.net/) - Better ad blocking for my home network / finally no Youtube ads!

So without further mention, let's dive in and get the thing up and running!
(Docker-compose files are based upon the components mentioned above)

--------------------------------------------

## 1. Clone Repo:

The project uses Git Submodules, make sure you clone the repo using:
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ultimate-pms/ultimate-media-server-core.git /opt/pms-scripts`

## 2. Setup services:
### 2.1 Install Docker & Docker Compose:

See here for Docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started
For Docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### 2.2 Install Plex & other applications mentioned

**NOTE:** Before running this, you should configure each docker-compose file accordingly!
By default everything will mount to a volume called `/nas` which should be a network s hare to your NAS/External Drive(s)...
Docker compose files are located in the `dockerfiles/server` directory.

```
# Copy compose files into /opt
cp -rp /opt/pms-scripts/dockerfiles/server/* /opt/

# Stand up each container... (go grab a coffee, this will take a while)
find /opt/ -maxdepth 1 -name "docker*" -type d \( ! -wholename /opt/ \) -exec bash -c "cd '{}' && docker-compose up -d" \;

```

## 3. Configure!

You'll now need to go and configure each service - there's various howto's on the Internet already, when I've got time I'll do a write up.

Useful URLs:

 - Jackett - `http://<server-ip>:9117/UI/Dashboard` - Start here, configure your torrent indexers to start...
 - qBittorrent - `http://<server-ip>:8080/` - This is your torrent client, you will ned to configure save-file location, password etc...
 - tvHeadend - `http://<server-ip>:9981/` - You'll need to configure tvHeadend with your favorite IPTV feeds if you want to use the Plex DVR Feature
 - Tautulli - `http://<server-ip>:8181/home` - Analytics about who's watching what media on your network
 - Sonarr - `http://<server-ip>:8988/` - Configure, then add in all your favorite TV series you want to start auto-downloading
 - Radarr `http://<server-ip>:7878/` - Configure Movies you want to start auto-downloading
 - Lidarr `http://<server-ip>:8686/` - Configure for any Music you want to start auto-downloading...
 - Plex - `http://<server-ip>:22500/` - **Access Your Plex Media Server!** (via Nginx proxy injecting TVHeadend CSS Fixes) - You should be port-forwarding to this one and sharing with your friends.
 - OpenSpeedtest - `http://<server-ip>:8081/` - Worth setting up port-forwarding to this, it will allow you to test the download speed (of you internet connection) when accessing your server remotely.
 - Ombi - `http://<server-ip>:3579/` - Worth setting up port-forwarding to this one also - It will allow your friends and family to "request" new Series, Movies etc to be added to your server (This way they don't need access to Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr)
 - Funkwhale - `http://<server-ip>:8881/` - This is the front-end for Funkwhale if you are using: [funkwhale-nginx-proxy](https://github.com/ultimate-pms/funkwhale-nginx-proxy)


## 4. Additional Automation & Maintenance Scripts

*NB:* Some of these Scripts you may want to run once off, others you may wish to schedule in a cron.

| Script                                                                               | Language    | Targets          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [radarr_rename-movie-files.sh](scripts/radarr/radarr_rename-movie-files.sh)                 | Bash        | Radarr (API)     | Quick and dirty script to hit the Radarr API and rename any movies (via the Radar API) so that they are correctly indexed in Plex
| [radarr_search-missing-movies.sh](scripts/radarr/radarr_search-missing-movies.sh)           | Bash        | Radarr (API)     | Script that hits the Radarr API to search for any missing movies (Ideally this should be scheduled with your CRON and run each night)
| [radarr_search-missing-movies-by-year](scripts/radarr/radarr_search-missing-movies-by-year.sh) | Bash     | Radarr (API)     | Same as previous script, but only searches missing movies that match a specific year (i.e. Only search missing movies from 2016)
| [radarr_cleanup-crappy-movies.sh](scripts/radarr/radarr_cleanup-crappy-movies.sh)           | Bash        | Radarr (API)     | I stupidly added in a list to Radarr that imported thousands of low ranking movies that I didn't want .... This is a quick and dirty script to find those movies on the NAS and blow them away if not yet downloaded
| [radarr_remove-undownloaded-movies.sh](scripts/radarr/radarr_remove-undownloaded-movies.sh) | Bash        | Radarr (API)     | I love my lists - but I don't like searching for movies older than year 1992 - Script finds any un-downloaded movies (auto populated from a list) and removes them
| [radarr_bulk-import-movies-hack.md](scripts/radarr/radarr_bulk-import-movies-hack.md)       | Javascript  | Radarr (Browser) | If you're like me and trying to import thousands of pre-downloaded movies (around 4,000+ movies) into Radarr, you're not going to want to click through the web-ui manually and add them all...
| [fake-video-detector](https://github.com/ultimate-pms/fake-video-detector)                  | Mixed       | CLI              | Automatically detect fake videos in your library based upon a 'database' of blacklisted videos
| [remove-completed-downloads](scripts/qbittorrent/qb_remove-completed-downloads.sh)          | Bash        | qBitTorrent      | qBitTorrent script to automatically remove any completed downloads from matching category (tv|movies) after X hours (The idea behind this is to allow Radarr/Sonar to copy & rename files, then this script will come and remove them after X hours so they still have time to seed)
| [convert-to-mp4](scripts/post-processing/convert-to-mp4.sh)                                 | Bash        | N/A              | Post processing script that you can hook into Radarr (or run on your filesystem via `run-nas.sh`) that converts all your video files into mp4 containers - *NO TRANSCODING IS DONE*, The original transcoding, subtitles, audio channels etc are all copied as is - This is a must have as Plex prefers to "direct stream" any content in MP4 format
| [remove-embedded-movie-titles](scripts/post-processing/remove-embedded-movie-title.sh)      | Bash        | N/A              | Post processing script that goes and strips any Metadata titles out of your video file names - This is great if your TV/Movie organizer (Radarr/Sonarr etc) is setup to rename your files as Plex will use the file name to sort Movie/TV not title that is in the file's metadata.
| [lidarr_search-missing-tracks](scripts/lidarr/lidarr_search-missing-tracks.sh)              | Bash        | Lidarr (API)     | Script to go and hit the Lidarr API (suggest scheduling via a cron each night) to "force search" for any missing tracks against your indexers...
| [lidarr_last-fm-adder](scripts/lidarr/lidarr_last-fm-adder.sh)                              | Bash        | Lidarr (API)     | Script to query the last.fm API and return new artists to add into your Lidarr search Library...
| [lidarr_refresh-filesystem](scripts/lidarr/lidarr_refresh-filesystem.sh)                    | Bash        | Lidarr (API)     | Iterates through each and every one of your Lidarr artists and triggers a refresh of files on on your filesystem (Useful if you add/update your music library outside of Lidarr so that Lidarr is kept in-sync with new music added)
| [funkwhale_bump-files](scripts/funkwhale/funkwhale_bump-files.sh)                           | Bash        | Funkwhale Importer | A script that runs the "Funkwhale Import" API command to import your music files into funkwhale, then it parses the log files and tries to fix any "known errors" (such as invalid ID3 tags) so that they will be successfully imported to Funkwhale on the next import run.

Here's a copy of my current cron jobs -- update paths accordingly:

```
